# I2C Peripheral

## Description
This project implements a SystemVerilog I2C slave peripheral that can operate in both Standard Mode (100 kHz) and Fast Mode (400 kHz). It supports 7-bit and 10-bit addressing, and includes two versions of the core:

- **Direct Access Core**: Exposes internal registers to the system for direct access.
- **Wishbone-Compatible Core**: Exposes a Wishbone B4 slave interface and an interrupt output when a write operation occurs.

Designed for both simulation and hardware deployment, this project builds practical skills in IP core design, communication protocols, and FPGA integration.

## **Features:**
- I2C Slave with support for:
  - 7-bit and 10-bit addresses
  - Standard (100 kHz) and Fast (400 kHz) modes
  - Repeated start detection
  - Auto-incrementing internal register addresses
- Two integration options:
  - Standalone with direct register access
  - Wishbone B4 slave interface with interrupt line
- Synthesizable for deployment on real hardware
- Testbench included for functional verification

## Tools & Platform

- **HDL**: SystemVerilog
- **Simulation**: Verilator + GTKWave
- **Synthesis**: Vivado 2024.2
- **Target FPGA**: Alchitry Pt V2 (Artix A7100T)
- **Testing Host**: Raspberry Pi 4 (optional, acts as I2C master)

## How to Use

### Simulation (via Verilator)
1. Navigate to the root directory
2. Run the testbench using:
```bash
make -C sim/
```
3. Open waveform:
```bash
gtkwave sim/waveform.vcd
```

### Synthesis and Deployment
1. Open Vivado
2. Run the provided script:
```tcl
source scripts/build_example.tcl
```
3. Program the Alchitry Pt V2 via USB

## Learnings & Takeaways
